# Who was Blanche Ames?
Born in 1878 in Lowell, Massachusetts, Blanche Ames was known for work as a botanical illustrator and a women’s rights and health advocate. From illustrating the seminal seven-volume text on orchids, *Illustrations and studies of the family Orchidaceae*, to co-founding the Birth Control League of Massachusetts, her achievements were many—and even include a U.S. patent for a technology to ensare enemy aircraft.[^1] The estate she built in with her husband, Oakes Ames, is now a Massacusetts [State Park](https://www.mass.gov/locations/borderland-state-park)—and famously one of the filming locations for 2017 horror film *Get Out*. Borderland, the name of the estate, is also the title of a 2020 documentary about Blanche and her women's rights activism, the trailer for which is on the right.

Like many women of the time who were able to enter science, Blanche graduated from a women’s college—Smith, in 1900—and her entry into the field of botany was enabled by connections to her male family members.[^2] First of all, she came from wealth—she was the daughter of <span eid="Q354194">General Adelbert Ames</span> and granddaughter of <span eid="Q817488">Massachusetts Governer Benjamin Butler</span>—and so had no pressing need to find work for pay. Her first forays into botanical illustration, following her visual arts degree from Smith, came in the form of illustrating the botanical research of her husband, Harvard botany professor Oakes Ames. Indeed, throughout her long career as a scientific illustrator and creator of educational materials, Blanche was never a professional, *per se*, nor did she draw a salary for her work. In fact, writing in a memorial after her death, the then-director of the Harvard Botanical Museum described Blanche as “wife and lifelong helpmeet of Professor Oakes Ames, second director of the Botanical Museum," and noted that despite her contribtusions to the institution—”so profound they will always be appreciated…in the Museum and…the world of botany”— “Blanche Ames never held an official appointment as member of the Museum staff.” [^3]

In this respect, Blanche's career in science bears similarity to the stories of women at Harvard’s Museum of Compartive Zoology in the same time period, as Reed Gochberg highlights in her exhibit ["Women of the Museum, 1860–1920: Behind-the-Screens at the Museum of Comparative Zoology."](https://hmsc.harvard.edu/women-museum) Even as women began to enter the workforce in clerical and secretarial roles at the turn of the 20th century—and to take on low-paying, feminized scientific jobs like astronomical computers and botanical assistants—many women of a higher social class, like Blanche Ames and Elizabeth Bangs Bryant,worked at Harvard’s museums as unpaid ‘volunteers' often in aid of the husbands’ or fathers’ research, considered 'amateur' by dint of their lack of salary, not of skill.[^4]

Acknowledging Blanche’s connections and privilege is not, of course, to diminish the quality of her scientific work nor her untiring civic participation. Outside her botanical work, and quite independent of her husband, Blanche was in her own right an advocate for women’s suffrage through her cartoons and organzing for the vote to legalize birth control. Later in life she served as board member, patron, and director of the New England Hospital for Women and Children—an institution designed to train women doctors and provide care *for* women *by* women, and itself a fascinating case study in the history of both women in medicine and advances in women’s health.

## The Botanical Illustrator, Educator
Blanche....visual art degree...illustrator...her husband, Oakes Ames, (title/role/position). She was especially known for her illustrations of orchids...and gave lectures? on them? posters for education Maybe
“Oakes and Blanche Ames worked together as a team from the beginning of their marriage in 1900.” “through the years made virtually all the illustrations for his botanical books” (1)
“Later, she made pen and ink drawings using a microscope and sometimes a camera lucida for scientifi exactness. The orchids she drew were dried or preserved in alcohol, but she transmuted them into the natural and the living” (1)This example is of an orchid native to Mexico and central america—as description says, lifelike and vivid in color.
Oakes wrote to his daughter, of the volume of orchids of florida, “I play ‘junior author’, being respisnible simply for the text’” (2)

 “It was not only in the illustration of Oakes’ many books and technical papers in orchidology that Blanche plate dher pat in the development of his major concern, the Botancal Museum In the 1920’s, she created the unique “Ames’ Charts”—phylogenetic charts of the Spermatophyte, which she illustrated with the important economic plants, thereby greatly enhancing the teaching of economic botany. These charts are still a basic tool in the teaching of the Harvard course “Plants and Human Affairs”. (Foreword, vi).
      
“Still in use today, the charts have helped interpret plant classdificatio to hundreds of students for more than fifty years and have tamped a unique character on Harvard’s teaching in [Economic Botany].” 254

## Harvard Botanic Garden
It is a fact perhaps little known on campus today, but from 1901 to 1961 Harvard scientists operated a botanical garden in Cuba. Today the Cienfuegos Botanical Garden owned by the Cuban government, it was first established by Boston-based merchant [Edwin Atkins](https://www.masshist.org/features/online/photographs/atkins)—in conjunction with Oakes Ames and George Goodale—as an experimental station for the growth of sugarcane for the immensely profitable sugar trade. Oakes Ames would be its director(years-years) in conjunction with his role at the Harvard Botanical Museum. This map, dated to 1903, is an original pen-and-ink drawing of Cuba and its surrounding territories, marking the location of Cienfuegos. Though unsigned, a posthumously-published collection of Oakes Ames’ writings attributes the map to Blanche. The map itself might strike a viewer as sparse or devoid of detail—that is, if you were expecting a navigational aid. Instead, this map appears to have served a largely symbolic purpose of establishing Harvard’s ownership of the Garden a mere two years after its founding.

The cartouche bearing the words “Harvard Botanical Garden” and the Harvard Veritas crest occupies about half as much space as Cuba itself; its borders are lined with delicate line drawings characteristic of Blanche’s botanical illustration, featuring tropical economic products the Garden was to produce for Harvard—like a <span data-click-image-zoomto="171,476,331,470">pineapple</span> and a banana tree. Blanche’s map was likely made for display in Boston, and functioned to create the imagined space of Cuba and Harvard’s tropical outpost in the minds of the Botanical Museum’s students, who in the next several decades were frequently sent to acquire experience there (CITE). (It bears mentioning that the founding of the Garden followed the Spanish-American War, and it was in many ways an imperial-scientific project. The outgrowth of the garden from sugarcane plantation…implicated…its research in the blood money of plantation system that extracted labor under oppressive conditions, even after the abolition of slavery).
This map is but one example of Blanche’s contribution to the running of Harvard’s Botanical Garden and Museum alongside her husband who held the formal role of Director at these institutions.

## The Suffragist Cartoonist
Blanche put her visual arts training to use as a political cartoonist, producing cartoons advocating for women's suffrage in such publications as X and Y. As research for her illustrations, Blanche (compiled or comissioned someone to compile) these scrapbooks, held at and digitized by the Schlesinger Library.

## Blanche's Archives at Harvard
Harvard is fortunate to host a wide collection of Blanche Ames’ papers, correspondence, and artwork across a number of holding libraries; the aim of this project was to bring some of these together to highlight Ames’ remarkable achievements across so many fields of endeavor. The Schlesinger Library holds a collection of Blanche Ames’ [papers](https://hollisarchives.lib.harvard.edu/repositories/8/resources/5221) and a separate digitized series of [her materials in the Women’s Suffrage collection](https://hollisarchives.lib.harvard.edu/repositories/8/resources/8098); the Botany Libraries hold materials from the [Botanical illustrations from the Oakes Ames Orchid Herbarium](https://hollisarchives.lib.harvard.edu/repositories/28/resources/10959#), including many of Ames’ botanical illustrations, educational posters, and artwork as well as those by other women artists; the Arnold Arboretum Archives holds the papers of other women scientists, like Susan McKelvey, who [corresponded with Blanche](https://hollisarchives.lib.harvard.edu/repositories/13/archival_objects/26700); the Harvard University Archives holds a [collection of Blanche Ames correspondence](https://hollisarchives.lib.harvard.edu/repositories/4/archival_objects/1088721) related to the Harvard Botanical Museum within the Oakes Ames papers; and finally, the Harvard Art Museum holds three of Blanche Ames’ [oil portraits](https://hvrd.art/o/304486).

# Who was Blanche Ames?
Born in 1878 in Lowell, Massachusetts, Blanche Ames was known for her work as a botanical illustrator and a women’s rights and health advocate. From producing hundreds of illustrations of orchids to co-founding the Birth Control League of Massachusetts, her achievements were many—and even include a U.S. patent for a technology to ensare enemy aircraft.[^1] The estate she built in with her husband, Oakes Ames, is now a Massacusetts [State Park](https://www.mass.gov/locations/borderland-state-park)—and famously one of the filming locations for 2017 horror film *Get Out*. Borderland, the name of the estate, is also the title of a 2020 documentary about Blanche and her women's rights activism, the trailer for which is on the right.

Like many women of the time who were able to enter science, Blanche graduated from a women’s college—Smith, in 1900—and her entry into the field of botany was enabled by connections to her male family members.[^2] First of all, she came from wealth—she was the daughter of <span eid="Q354194">General Adelbert Ames</span> and granddaughter of <span eid="Q817488">Massachusetts Governer Benjamin Butler</span>—and so had no pressing need to find work for pay. Her first forays into botanical illustration, following her visual arts degree from Smith, came in the form of illustrating the botanical research of her husband, Harvard botany professor Oakes Ames. Indeed, throughout her long career as a scientific illustrator and creator of educational materials, Blanche was never a professional, *per se*, nor did she draw a salary for her work. In fact, writing in a memorial after her death, the then-director of the Harvard Botanical Museum described Blanche as “wife and lifelong helpmeet of Professor Oakes Ames, second director of the Botanical Museum," and noted that despite her contribtusions to the institution—"so profound they will always be appreciated…in the Museum and…the world of botany”— “Blanche Ames never held an official appointment as member of the Museum staff.” [^3]

In this respect, Blanche's career in science bears similarity to the stories of women at Harvard’s Museum of Compartive Zoology in the same time period, as Reed Gochberg highlights in her exhibit ["Women of the Museum, 1860–1920: Behind-the-Screens at the Museum of Comparative Zoology."](https://hmsc.harvard.edu/women-museum) Even as women began to enter the workforce in clerical and secretarial roles at the turn of the 20th century—and to take on low-paying, feminized scientific jobs like astronomical computers and botanical assistants—many women of a higher social class, like Blanche Ames and [Elizabeth Bangs Bryant](https://hmsc.harvard.edu/beyond-museum), worked at Harvard’s museums as unpaid ‘volunteers' often in aid of the husbands’ or fathers’ research, considered 'amateur' by dint of their lack of salary though not of skill.[^4]

Acknowledging Blanche’s connections and privilege is not, of course, to diminish the quality of her scientific work nor her untiring civic participation. Outside her botanical work, and supported by her husband, Blanche was in her own right an advocate for women’s suffrage through her cartoons and organzing for the vote to legalize birth control. Later in life she served as board member, patron, and director of the New England Hospital for Women and Children—an institution designed to train women doctors and provide care *for* women *by* women, and itself a fascinating case study in the history of both women in medicine and advances in women’s health.

## The Botanical Illustrator & Educator
Blanche first turned her hand to botanical illustration in collaboration with her husband's orchid research, and “through the years made virtually all the illustrations for his botanical books.”[^5] Her work was both artistic and rigorously scientific—her daughter described Blanche making her drawings "using a microscope and sometimes a camera lucida for scientific exactness," working from specimens "dried or preserved in alcohol" that Blanche's skill in illustration and coloring "transmuted..into the natural and the living."[^6] This lifelike and vividly colorful illustration, of the *Maxillaria tenuifolia* orchid native to Mexico and Central America, is evidence of Blanche's skill. By all accounts, Oakes greatly admired his wife's abilities and considered her an equal collaborator. Blanche's name appears at the bottom of the illustrated plates in Oakes'[*Illustrations and studies of the family Orchidaceae*](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/15433), but in the later volume they produced together, *Drawings of Florida Orchids* (1959), her name is listed as first author. In a letter to his daughter Pauline, Oakes praised Blanche's illustrations and wrote of the volume, “I play ‘junior author’, being responsible simply for the text.”[^7] Although coming later in her career, this recognition of authorship firmly established Blanche's title of botanical "researcher" alongside her husband, in recognition of the depth of her expertise and the importance of her contributions to bontical knowledge.

Yet it was not only in her illustrations that Blanche "played her part in the development of [Oakes'] major concern, the Botanical Museum."[^8] In the 1920s, Blanche produced a series of educational charts, showing both the phylogentic relationships and key economic botany products of different plant groups. The banner image of this site, for example, featurers her illustrations of the Archichlamydae, and the image to the right is her poster of Gymnosperms. This unqiue illustration tool is literally a phylogenetic *tree*, cleverly using morphological features of different gymnosperms—like cones and leaves—to illustrate each genera and their inter-relations. The posters were used to teach a Harvard course entitled "Plants and Human Affairs," and in 1969 were still in use, having "helped interpret plant classification to hundreds of students for more than fifty years and...stamped a unique character on Harvard’s teaching in [Economic Botany].” [^9] The original posters on canvas are held by Harvard's Botany Libraries, and today framed versions line Harvard University Herbarium lobby and the Botany Libraries reading room. Though never a professor herself, its is clear that Blanche had significant influence on the pedagogy of botany at Harvard even before Harvard classes first opened to Radcliffe women in 1946.

## The Cartographer: Harvard Botanic Garden
It is a fact perhaps little known on campus today, but from 1901 to 1961 Harvard scientists operated a botanical garden in Cuba. Today the Cienfuegos Botanical Garden owned by the Cuban government, it was first established by Boston-based merchant [Edwin Atkins](https://www.masshist.org/features/online/photographs/atkins)—in conjunction with Harvard botanists Oakes Ames and George Goodale—as an experimental station for the growth of sugarcane for the immensely profitable sugar trade. As with the Botanical Museum, Blanche was connected to the institution through her husband Oakes Ames—he would be the Garden's Assistant Director and then Director from its founding until 1922 before assuming his administrative roles at the Botanical Museum, which he held until 1950. This map, dated to 1903, is an original pen-and-ink drawing of Cuba and its surrounding territories, marking the location of Cienfuegos. Though unsigned, a posthumously-published collection of Oakes Ames’ writings attributes the map to Blanche.[^10] The map itself might strike a viewer as sparse or devoid of detail—that is, if you were expecting a navigational aid. Instead, this map appears to have served a largely symbolic purpose of establishing Harvard’s ownership of the Garden a mere two years after its founding.

The cartouche bearing the words “Harvard Botanical Garden” and the Harvard Veritas crest occupies about half as much space as Cuba itself, showing its outsize importance; its borders are lined with delicate line drawings characteristic of Blanche’s botanical illustration, featuring tropical economic products the Garden was to produce for Harvard—like a <span data-click-image-zoomto="171,476,331,470">pineapple</span> and a banana tree. Blanche’s map was likely made for display in Boston, and functioned to create the imagined place of Cuba and Harvard’s tropical outpost in the minds of the Botanical Museum’s students, who in the next several decades were frequently sent to acquire experience there.[^11] This map is but one example of Blanche’s contribution to the running of Harvard’s Botanical Garden and Museum alongside her husband who held formal administrative roles. It bears mentioning that the founding of the Garden followed the Spanish-American War, and was in many ways an imperial-scientific project. The outgrowth of the Garden from the Atkins' sugarcane plantation implicated its research in the plantation system that extracted labor under oppressive conditions, even after the abolition of slavery.[^12] The Garden's research under Oakes Ames involved frequent collaboration and knowledge-sharing with the infamously exploitative and politically destablizing United Fruit Company in Honduras [^13]. This is a pertinent reminder, as we consider the contributions of women to science, that the science to which they contributed *itself* demands interrogation—and representation is not an absolute good that we can champion in the absence of a critique of imperial economic botany.

## The Suffragist Cartoonist
Besides her work in botanical illustration, Blanche also put her visual arts training to use as a political cartoonist, producing eight cartoons advocating for women's suffrage in such publications as the *Boston Transcript* and the *Woman’s Journal and Suffrage News*. Blanche authored these cartoons in 1915, in the lead up to a referendum on an article that would grant women the right to vote in Massachusetts.[^14] As research for her illustrations, Blanche compiled scrapbooks of news clippings, stickers, and other print materials. These scrapbooks are held at and digitized by the Schlesinger Library, and a sample page is presented in the viewer to the right. Notice the "Votes for Women" stamps on the right of the page, and the roster of the Men's League for Women's Suffrage pasted at the bottom. The Schlesinger's folders of Blanche's papers contain many such lists of potential voters and donors that she maintained, doubtless to facilitate a wide network of allies for her advocacy work. The Needham League of Women Voters hosted an [online exhibition](https://lwv-needham.org/suffrage-cartoons-of-blanche-ames-2/) of Blanche's cartoons that brings together each of her cartoons alongside context on the suffrage fight at the time. Unfortunately the 1915 vote in Massachusetts failed, but this experience did not deter Blanche—she went on to advocate for a number of other women's causes, in the political sphere and in healthcare, for the rest of her life.

## The Women's Health Advocate, Patron & Administrator

One such cause to which Blanche was devoted was the fight for the right of Massachusetts women to access contraceptives and birth control, which she saw a crucial women's health issue. In 1916, Blanche co-founded the Birth Control League of Massachusetts, and served as its President for 19 years a years. Her public advocacy work includes a letter addressed to "my dear fellow-citizens" of Masachussetts, pleading the public not to let Roman Catholic religious doctrine dictate the matter of public health in response to the 1930 Papal Encycical decrying birth control as a sin. Without mincing words, Blanche wrote: "We who are not members of the Catholic Church cannot submit to its domination in this case without sacrificing the lives and the health of married women and their babies."[^15] She was denouncing Catholic opposition to Senate Bill No. 43 at the MA State House in 1931, which unfortunately prevailed. The pamphlet to the right is among the print materials related to birth control that Blanche collected, this time for a referendum on contraceptive use in 1942—even dissemination of information about birth control was illegal in the state at the time. There was a long road still ahead, as birth control did not become legalized in Massachusetts for both married and unmarried women until 1972.[^16]

Blanche was also closely involved with the New England Hospital for Women and Children and became its President in 1941. The Hospital was founded on July 1, 1862 by <span eid="Q276312"> Marie Zakrzewska </span>, with the goal of training women physicians and improving access to healthcare for women. The letter displayed on the right...shows her commitment to the Hospital's founding principle of primarily hiring and training women doctors. Indeed, Blanche led a fundraising campaign to ensure that...this could continue. Her folders...also include annual reports of the New England Hospital dating back to 18??, which in themselves represent a remarkable archive of women in medical science in America.

## Conclusion: Blanche's Archives at Harvard
It is difficult to sum up a life and corpus as wide-ranging as that of Blanche Ames. A devoted feminist, Blanche harnessed her privilege not only to pursue a career in botany as a woman scientist, but also to fight for women's rights and healthcare as a patron of science *for* women. To be sure, the battles she fought were not always won, but nonetheless she is remembered as a pioneering figure in her fields. Though her status and proximity to power allowed her to side step many of the limitations imposed upon women at the time, Blanche was of course not unaffected by sexism. Her husband's name often overshadowed her own, even in her 1969 obituary in the *New York Times*, which was titled "Mrs. Oakes Ames, Botanist's Widow." [^] Botanical Museum Director Richard Schultes characterized Blanche as follows: “If Mrs. Ames had been a man, we would have said of her that she was a ‘man of parts’...a person of much ability and many talents.” [^] The hypothetical—what if she had been a man?—is an open question we might ask of many 20th century women scientists. In Blanche's case, it is hard to imagaine a more storied life than her own. But Schultes' comment does reflect a double standard—if she had been a man, there would be a ready-made phrase to describe her abilities, which were unthinkable in the vocabulary associated with women. Women scientists had to—perhaps still have to—be exceptional to earn the dubious reward of positive comparison to men.

Harvard is fortunate to host a wide collection of Blanche Ames’ papers, correspondence, and artwork across a number of holding libraries; the aim of this project was to bring some of these together to highlight Ames’ remarkable achievements across so many fields of endeavor. The Schlesinger Library holds a collection of Blanche Ames’ [papers](https://hollisarchives.lib.harvard.edu/repositories/8/resources/5221) and a separate digitized series of [her materials in the Women’s Suffrage collection](https://hollisarchives.lib.harvard.edu/repositories/8/resources/8098); the Botany Libraries hold materials from the [Botanical illustrations from the Oakes Ames Orchid Herbarium](https://hollisarchives.lib.harvard.edu/repositories/28/resources/10959#), including many of Ames’ botanical illustrations, educational posters, and artwork as well as those by other women artists; the Arnold Arboretum Archives holds the papers of other women scientists, like Susan McKelvey, who [corresponded with Blanche](https://hollisarchives.lib.harvard.edu/repositories/13/archival_objects/26700); the Harvard University Archives holds a [collection of Blanche Ames correspondence](https://hollisarchives.lib.harvard.edu/repositories/4/archival_objects/1088721) related to the Harvard Botanical Museum within the Oakes Ames papers; and finally, the Harvard Art Museum holds three of Blanche Ames’ [oil portraits](https://hvrd.art/o/304486).

# Who was Blanche Ames?
Born in 1878 in Lowell, Massachusetts, Blanche Ames was known for work as a botanical illustrator and a women’s rights and health advocate. From illustrating the seminal seven-volume text on orchids, *Illustrations and studies of the family Orchidaceae*, to co-founding the Birth Control League of Massachusetts, her achievements were many—and even include a U.S. patent for a technology to ensare enemy aircraft.[^1] The estate she built in with her husband, Oakes Ames, is now a Massacusetts [State Park](https://www.mass.gov/locations/borderland-state-park)—and famously one of the filming locations for 2017 horror film *Get Out*. Borderland, the name of the estate, is also the title of a 2020 documentary about Blanche and her women's rights activism, the trailer for which is on the right.

Like many women of the time who were able to enter science, Blanche graduated from a women’s college—Smith, in 1900—and her entry into the field of botany was enabled by connections to her male family members.[^2] First of all, she came from wealth—she was the daughter of <span eid="Q354194">*General Adelbert Ames *</span> and granddaughter of <span eid="Q817488">*Massachusetts Governer Benjamin Butler*</span>r—and so had no pressing need to find work for pay. Her first forays into botanical illustration, following her visual arts degree from Smith, came in the form of illustrating the botanical research of her husband, Harvard botany professor Oakes Ames. Indeed, throughout her long career as a scientific illustrator and creator of educational materials, Blanche was never a professional, *per se*, nor did she draw a salary for her work. In fact, writing in a memorial after her death, the then-director of the Harvard Botanical Museum described Blanche as “wife and lifelong helpmeet of Professor Oakes Ames, second director of the Botanical Museum," and noted that despite her contribtusions to the institution—”so profound they will always be appreciated…in the Museum and…the world of botany”— “Blanche Ames never held an official appointment as member of the Museum staff.” [^3]

In this respect, Blanche's career in science bears similarity to the stories of women at Harvard’s Museum of Compartive Zoology in the same time period, as Reed Gochberg highlights in her exhibit ["Women of the Museum, 1860–1920: Behind-the-Screens at the Museum of Comparative Zoology."](https://hmsc.harvard.edu/women-museum). Even as women began to enter the workforce in clerical and secretarial roles at the turn of the 20th century—and to take on low-paying, feminized scientific jobs like astronomical computers and botanical assistants—many women of a higher social class, like Blanche Ames and Elizabeth Bangs Bryant,worked at Harvard’s museums as unpaid ‘volunteers' often in aid of the husbands’ or fathers’ research, considered 'amateur' by dint of their lack of salary, not of skill.[^4]

Acknowledging Blanche’s connections and privilege is not, of course, to diminish the quality of her scientific work nor her untiring civic participation. Outside her botanical work, and quite independent of her husband, Blanche was in her own right an advocate for women’s suffrage through her cartoons and organzing for the vote to legalize birth control. Later in life she served as board member, patron, and director of the New England Hospital for Women and Children—an institution designed to train women doctors and provide care *for* women *by* women, and itself a fascinating case study in the history of both women in medicine and advances in women’s health.

## The Botanical Illustrator, Educator
Blanche....visual art degree...illustrator...her husband, Oakes Ames, (title/role/position). She was especially known for her illustrations of orchids...and gave lectures? on them? posters for education Maybe[^1]

## Botanical Museum & Botanic Gardens
Perhaps little known fact—–Harvard owned/operated a botanical gardens in Cuba until (year). This map...shows the approach to the gardens. Made while her husband, Oakes was director. Suggest some reading on the Harvad botanic gardens in Cuba as imperial outpost.

## The Suffragist Cartoonist
Blanche put her visual arts training to use as a political cartoonist, producing cartoons advocating for women's suffrage in such publications as X and Y. As research for her illustrations, Blanche (compiled or comissioned someone to compile) these scrapbooks, held at and digitized by the Schlesinger Library.

## Blanche's Archives at Harvard
Harvard is fortunate to host a wide collection of Blanche Ames’ papers, correspondence, and artwork across a number of holding libraries; the aim of this project was to bring some of these together to highlight Ames’ remarkable achievements across so many fields of endeavor. The Schlesinger Library holds a collection of Blanche Ames’ [papers](https://hollisarchives.lib.harvard.edu/repositories/8/resources/5221) and a separate digitized series of [her materials in the Women’s Suffrage collection](https://hollisarchives.lib.harvard.edu/repositories/8/resources/8098); the Botany Libraries hold materials from the [Botanical illustrations from the Oakes Ames Orchid Herbarium](https://hollisarchives.lib.harvard.edu/repositories/28/resources/10959#), including many of Ames’ botanical illustrations, educational posters, and artwork as well as those by other women artists; the Arnold Arboretum Archives holds the papers of other women scientists, like Susan McKelvey, who [corresponded with Blanche](https://hollisarchives.lib.harvard.edu/repositories/13/archival_objects/26700); the Harvard University Archives holds a [collection of Blanche Ames correspondence](https://hollisarchives.lib.harvard.edu/repositories/4/archival_objects/1088721) related to the Harvard Botanical Museum within the Oakes Ames papers; and finally, the Harvard Art Museum holds three of Blanche Ames’ [oil portraits](https://hvrd.art/o/304486).

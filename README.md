# Who was Blanche Ames?
Born in 1878…Blanche… known as botanical illustrator and women’s rights advocate…her achievements far and wide, and include even a U.S. patent for ensaring enemy aircraft.[^1] The estate she built/lived in with her husband, Oakes Ames, is now a Massacusetts State Park…and…active historical society…made a documentary about her.
*insert link to documentary trailer*
       
Like many women of the time who were able to enter science, Blanche graduated from a women’s college—Smith, in 1900—and her entry was enabled by connections to her male family members.(CITE Rossiter here).[^2]  First of all, she came from wealth—the daughter of ? and ?—and so had no pressing need to find work for pay. Her first forays into botanical illustration, following her visual arts degree from Smith, came in the form of illustrating the botanical research of her husband, Harvard botany professor Oakes Ames. Indeed, throughout her long career as a scientific illustrator and creator of educational materials, Blanche was never a professional, per se, nor did she draw a salary for her work.In fact, writing in a memorial after her death, the then-director of the Botanical Museum described Blanche as “wife and lifelong helpmeet of Professor Oakes Ames, second director of the Botanical Museum,"and noted that despite her contribtusions to the institution—”so profound they will always be appreciated…in the Museum and…the world of botany”— “Blanche Ames never held an official appointment as member of the Museum staff.”[^3]

In this respect, her work…bears similarity to the stories of women at Harvard’s Museum of Compartive Zoology in the same time period, as Reed Gochberg highlights in (link to exhibit). Even as women began to enter the workforce in clerical and secretarial roles at the turn of the 20th century, many women of a certain social class—like Elizabeth Bangs Bryant—worked at Harvard’s museums as ‘volunteers’ or in aid of the husbands’ or fathers’ research (LINK). [^4]
       
Acknowledging Blanche’s connections and privilege is not, of course, to diminish the quality of her scientific work nor her untiring civic participation. Outside her botanical work, and quite independent of her husband, Blanche was in her own right an advocate…for women’s suffrage, cartoons and organsing, galvanising the vote for legalising birth control, and she served as board member, patron, and director of the New England Hospital for Women and Children—an institution designed to train women doctors and provide care for women by women, and so itself a fascinating case study…of the field…of both women in medicine and advances in women’s health.

## Botanical Museum & Botanic Gardens
Perhaps little known fact—–Harvard owned/operated a botanical gardens in Cuba until (year). This map...shows the approach to the gardens. Made while her husband, Oakes was director. Suggest some reading on the Harvad botanic gardens in Cuba as imperial outpost.

## The Suffragist Cartoonist
Blanche put her visual arts training to use as a political cartoonist, producing cartoons advocating for women's suffrage in such publications as X and Y. As research for her illustrations, Blanche (compiled or comissioned someone to compile) these scrapbooks, held at and digitized by the Schlesinger Library.

## Blanche's Archives at Harvard
Harvard is fortunate to host a wide collection of Blanche Ames’ papers, correspondence, and artwork across a number of holding libraries; the aim of this project was to bring some of these together to highlight Ames’ remarkable achievements across so many fields of endeavor. The Schlesinger Library holds a collection of Blanche Ames’ [papers](https://hollisarchives.lib.harvard.edu/repositories/8/resources/5221) and a separate digitized series of [her materials in the Women’s Suffrage collection](https://hollisarchives.lib.harvard.edu/repositories/8/resources/8098); the Botany Libraries hold materials from the [Botanical illustrations from the Oakes Ames Orchid Herbarium](https://hollisarchives.lib.harvard.edu/repositories/28/resources/10959#), including many of Ames’ botanical illustrations, educational posters, and artwork as well as those by other women artists; the Arnold Arboretum Archives holds the papers of other women scientists, like Susan McKelvey, who [corresponded with Blanche](https://hollisarchives.lib.harvard.edu/repositories/13/archival_objects/26700); the Harvard University Archives holds a [collection of Blanche Ames correspondence](https://hollisarchives.lib.harvard.edu/repositories/4/archival_objects/1088721) related to the Harvard Botanical Museum within the Oakes Ames papers; and finally, the Harvard Art Museum holds three of Blanche Ames’ [oil portraits](https://hvrd.art/o/304486).
